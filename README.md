# Autonomous_Robotics_CS639
Robots sense and act to change the physical world. This course introduces methods for building autonomous robots that make decisions in uncertain, unstructured environments, covering state estimation, localization, SLAM, motion control, planning, learning, and human–robot interaction. Emphasis is placed on rigorous algorithmic design and evaluation
